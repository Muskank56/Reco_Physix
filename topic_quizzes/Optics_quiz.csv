Q Type your question
that we receive from the sun is
transferred to us by a process which,
unlike conduction or convection, does
not require the help of a medium in the intervening space which is almost free of particles. Radiant energy travels in space as electromagnetic spectrum.
Thermal radiations travel through
vacuum with the speed of light. Thermal
radiations obey the same laws of
reflection and refraction as light does.
They exhibit the phenomena of interference, diffraction and
polarization as light does.
The emission of radiation from a hot
body is expressed in terms of that emitted from a reference body (called
the black body at the same
temperature. A black body absorbs and
hence emits radiations of all
wavelengths. The total energy E emitted
by a unit area of a black body per
second is given by \( \boldsymbol{E}=\boldsymbol{\sigma} \boldsymbol{T}^{4} \) where \( \boldsymbol{T} \) is
the absolute temperature of the body
and \( \sigma \) is a constant known as Stefan's
constant. If the body is not a perfect
black body, then \( E=\varepsilon \sigma T^{4} \) where \( \varepsilon \) is
the emissivity of the body.
